    "# Spread of an infectious disease\n",
    "In our project, we are looking at the spread of a contagious disease in an enclosed space. In this room there are a predefined number of beds with patients in them. First, a patient is infected. The patient can infect the other patients on each side of his bed. Now it can be simulated over an arbitrary period of time how the disease spreads. It is possible to change the conditions of spreading with the help of different parameters. Among other things, the size of the room, the probability of infection or the bed of the first infected person can be changed. It is also possible to include other things in the simulation. For example, it is possible to vaccinate patients or move beds every day. In the following we will go into more detail about each part of the program and at the end we will show some examples of its use.\n",
    "In the following, we will first explain the meaning of each variable. Then we will take a closer look at all the functions used to simulate the spreading. Next, we will explain how we have animated the simulation and finally we will show examples of how the simulation can be used properly.\n",
