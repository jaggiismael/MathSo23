    "# Spread of an infectious disease\n",
    "In our project, we are looking at the spread of a contagious disease in an enclosed space. In this room there are a predefined number of beds with patients in them. First, a patient is infected. The patient can infect the other patients on each side of his bed. Now it can be simulated over an arbitrary period of time how the disease spreads. It is possible to change the conditions of spreading with the help of different parameters. Among other things, the size of the room, the probability of infection or the bed of the first infected person can be changed. It is also possible to include other things in the simulation. For example, it is possible to vaccinate patients or move beds every day. In the following we will go into more detail about each part of the program and at the end we will show some examples of its use.\n",
    "In the following, we will first explain the meaning of each variable. Then we will take a closer look at all the functions used to simulate the spreading. Next, we will explain how we have animated the simulation and finally we will show examples of how the simulation can be used properly.\n",

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "In this project, we learned a lot about the spread of disease. At the beginning, we thought that it was very easy to predict the spread. But as we wrote the first function with the probability of infection and room size, we quickly realized that things that didn't matter in our minds at first can make a huge difference. As we refined the function and added the ability to vaccinate people and swap beds, the simulation became more and more realistic. Adding the incubation period made a much bigger difference than we thought at the beginning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, after we finished the simulation function and we could see the different spreads with the help of the animations, we started to play with different values. Now, for example, in the corona pandemic, we understand the role of lockdown much more clearly, because if we don't exchange beds, the disease spreads much less quickly and is easier to contain. The importance of vaccination has also been demonstrated in our simulation. Because you manage to protect many people from infection and thus they can not infect other people.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we can say that we were very satisfied with our topic and really enjoyed the simulation. We have made many new exciting discoveries and have also learned a new programming language. The cooperation worked wonderfully and we are very satisfied with the result of our work.\n"
